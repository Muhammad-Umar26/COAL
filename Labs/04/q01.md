.data

.code
	main proc
		MOV AX 3d       ; comma missing between operands
		MOV 23, AX      ; immediate number can not be placed at destination
		MOV CX, CH      ; can not move from 16 to 32 bits using "MOV" instruction
		MOVE AX, 1h     ; "MOVE" should be "MOV"
		ADD 2, CX       ; immediate number can not be placed at destination
		ADD 3, 6        ; immediate number can not be placed at destination
		INC AX, 2       ; "INC" instruction only takes one operand
